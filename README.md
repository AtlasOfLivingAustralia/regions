# Regions [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/regions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/regions)

The regions web application is a small grails 3 application that uses services from the Atlas of Living Australia (or another Living Atlas instance)
to present regional data breakdowns.

It uses services from:

* Biocache (https://biocache.ala.org.au/ws)
* Layers services (https://spatial.ala.org.au/ws)
